    <td heigh="160" colspan="5" align="left"> 1. First of all, make a choice based on where your site users are located.
If most of your site users are in China, then domestic space is certainly the first choice.
If it is overseas, select the overseas space of the corresponding node.
So the company uses the domestic host, so that users access the site speed is the fastest.<br>
2. Next comes the choice of storage space.
This needs the space of the site to be able to accommodate the site.
The average site size is around 30 megabytes, so 100 megabytes is plenty of space and can be used as you like.<br>
3. You also need to consider the size of the site traffic.
Because the service provider in order to ensure the speed of the operation of each server site, each virtual host monthly traffic has to do a limit.
The average site traffic size is around 10G, so 20G is enough to use.<br>
4. Server stability and security are also very important.
So it is necessary to try to find a large, experienced service providers.<br><br>
In general, when the price is similar, only Hichina generally meets the conditions. Therefore, I will choose Hichina as the server hosting site.
