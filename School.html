	<p>Shijiazhuang No.40 School is a well-known middle school in the city. I have a lot of memories of this school. Our school has many activities, various sports activities, and a lot of chemistry and physics equipment for us to do experiments. We will also organize spring outings to broaden our horizons. The teachers who taught us are also very professional and patient, not only let us learn knowledge, but also full of fun in the classroom.</p>

	<p>Shijiazhuang No. 1 High School is a key school in the province. I have lived in two campuses, one is the east campus and the other is the main campus.The two campuses are very beautiful and the teachers are also great. What impressed me the most was the beautiful big fish pond in the teaching building, with many cute little fishes swimming in it. My usual after-school activity is to play football on the playground. Although it will be tired after the end, it is also very happy. I have a lot of friends in high school. We always keep in touch. Whenever I return to my hometown, I hang out with them.</p>
